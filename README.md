# RNN_CHIMERAS

In this project you have different programs that are used for three different objectives. 1rst objective: Generate the supervisor (chimera). 2nd objective: train a RNN using the FORCE method to mimic the chimera state previously generated. 3rd objective: Plot and analize the RNN (basically the figures in the article). 

The chimera state was produced with the C++ code. Depending on the number of nodes (n = 3 or n = 25) the initial conditions change (see code to choose accordingly).
The training of the RNN was done with the python codes. Different codes are used for different constrains (see title). Finally, you have the scripts to produce the different figures in the paper.
