# RNN_CHIMERAS

In this project you have two diferent codes: the one to generate the supervisor (chimera) and the one to train a RNN using the FORCE method to mimic 
the chimera state previously generated. 

The chimera state was produced with the C++ code. Depending on the number of nodes (N = 3 or N = 25) the initial conditions change (see code to choose accordingly).
The training of the RNN was done with the python codes. Different codes are used for different constrains.
